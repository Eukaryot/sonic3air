
Build for Windows with Visual Studio 2019

SDL2
	- Open the Visual Studio Solution at "SDL2\VisualC\SDL.sln"
	- Changed needed after download
		1.) Switch to static library build for project SDL2 (alle Configurations):
			 General -> Configuration Type = "Static library (.lib)"
		2.) Link statically against the VC++ runtime, for projects SDL2 and SDL2main:
			 C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library = "Multi-threaded (/MT)" (yes, also for Debug)
	- Build as Debug + Release, both Win32 + x64
	- Without further adjustments, all other projects except SDL2 and SDL2main will fail to build, but we only need those anyway
	- Afterwards execute "copy_sdl.bat" to copy headers and libs in place


Notes on SDL2 static builds
	- Static builds don't work for x64, only for x86 builds
	- The following libraries need to be linked separately under Windows if you link to SDL2 statically:
		winmm.lib, imm32.lib, version.lib, setupapi.lib
