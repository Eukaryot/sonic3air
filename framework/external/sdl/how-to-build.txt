
=== Build for Windows with Visual Studio 2022 ===


Using the build script
	- Just execute "build_sdl.bat" and you're done


Alternative: Manual build
	- Open the Visual Studio Solution at "SDL2\VisualC\SDL.sln"
	- If you got a fresh copy of SDL from its repo (e.g. updating to a newer version), go through the steps under "Fixes to apply after updating" first
	- Build as Debug + Release, both Win32 + x64
	- Without further adjustments, all other projects except SDL2 and SDL2main will fail to build, but we only need those anyway
	- Afterwards execute "copy_sdl.bat" to copy headers and libs in place


Fixes to apply after updating
	- Optional: Build SDL for static linking
		- Switch to static library build for project SDL2 (all configurations):
			General -> Configuration Type = "Static library (.lib)"
		- Link statically against the VC++ runtime, for projects SDL2 and SDL2main:
			C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library = "Multi-threaded (/MT)" (yes, also for Debug)
		- Add the HAVE_LIBC definition into "SDL2\include\SDL_config_windows"
	- That's all... as of SDL 2.30.14, no further fixes are known tor be applied


Notes on SDL2 static builds
	- The following libraries need to be linked separately under Windows if you link to SDL2 statically:
		winmm.lib, imm32.lib, version.lib, setupapi.lib
