
MAIN SONIC 3 A.I.R. SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

 -> The Sonic 3 A.I.R. scripts are based on a conversion of the 68K machine code in the original Sonic 3 & Knuckles ROM.

 -> This conversion and subsequent manual code touch-ups was done by Eukaryot, as well as the addition of code changes
	to make the scripts run in the Oxygen Engine, together with bug fixes and new features for Sonic 3 A.I.R.



COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTIONS

 -> Additional code touch-ups and documentation improvements were added by Vinegar, from his fork at:
	https://github.com/vinegar97/sonic3air

 -> Several bug fixes were provided by members of the Sonic 3 A.I.R. community, these are marked in the scripts with
	a commented including "#contributed" and can be found by searching for that tag
