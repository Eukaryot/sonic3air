	// NOTE:
	//  Some properties here in config.json are also stored in settings.json in the save data directory.
	//  If a property is set in both files, which one is actually used by the game will depend on the platform:
	//    - On desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac), config.json is preferred. That also means that if a property is not set
	//      in config.json, it uses the last saved value from settings.json, and NOT the default value.
	//    - On other platforms the config.json usually is not directly accessible at all, so settings.json is always preferred.
